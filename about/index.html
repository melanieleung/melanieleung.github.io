	<h1>About</h1>
	<h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
	<p>
  I am interested in both teaching and using spatial data science for the purposes of sustainable natural resource management.
  You can see what I am mostly up to on my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/melaniesleung">LinkedIn</a>
		I also occasionally tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/melaniesleung">@melaniesleung"</a>
  
  This year, I worked for NASA's DEVELOP program on aquatic remote sensing projects: the <a href="https://www.devpedia.developexchange.com/dp/index.php?title=Florida_Transportation_%26_Infrastructure_ARC_Summer_2021">Florida Transportation & Infrastructure Project</a>, and the <a href="https://www.devpedia.developexchange.com/dp/index.php?title=Southern_California_Health_%26_Air_Quality_ARC_Fall_2021">Southern California Health & Air Quality Project</a>
  Using satellite imagery, my team and I worked to create graphical user interfaces to help monitor water quality conditions such as turbidity and chlorophyll-a trends.
  
  Right now, I am working on a remote sensing project with a lab in UCLA's Geography department. I process drone images to monitor
  trends of kelp canopies in the northern coast of California. 
  
  Before I got into geographic information systems (GIS), I did a decent amount of graphic design work. Sometimes I still mess around in Procreate and Adobe Illustrator.
  I'm trying to use old design skills to make cool maps now- I think cartography is pretty neat.
